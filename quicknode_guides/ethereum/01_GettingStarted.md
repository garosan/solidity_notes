# QuickNode Guides - Ethereum - Getting Started

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized and open-sourced blockchain network that allows anyone in the world to participate and interact with it.

In Ethereu, you can store digital assets, conduct payments, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps).

### What is Ethereum used for?

- **Ethereum Wallets**: wallets allow you to store cryptocurrency, send cryptocurrency and interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum wallets generally contain more than one account and are secured by cryptography. Each account tied to your wallet has a public and private key which is used when sending and receiving transactions.

- **Smart contracts**: Smart contracts are programs deployed on the blockchain that automate decision-making based on the contract rules. Smart contracts are immutable (generally speaking) and rely on the security of Ethereum (i.e., the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism).

- **Use cases**:
  - Financial services: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) (e.g., payments, trading exchanges, lending protocols, derivatives.
  - Collectibles: NFTs (e.g., collectibles such as digital and physical assets)
  - Gaming
  - Logistics (e.g., supply chain management)

## What is the EVM?

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a core piece of Ethereum that helps power the blockchain and smart contracts.

The EVM is the computation engine that powers Ethereum. It is contained within the client software (e.g., Geth, Nethermind, etc.) that you need to run a node. Nodes on Ethereum keep copies of transaction data, which the EVM processes to update the distributed ledger.

The EVM participates in block creation and transaction execution. In block creation, the EVM sets standards for managing the state from block to block. These states are stored in a **Merkle Patricia Trie** and hold the ground truth state for Ethereum.

In transaction execution, the EVM executes tasks (e.g., function calls to a smart contract) by interpreting the instructions in _opcodes_ (something similar to Assembly language). _But_, it happens like this:

- A smart contract developer writes smart contract code in Solidity or another language
- The developer compiles the files and the result is bytecode
- The bytecode contains all the instructions the EVM needs to run the contract, and itâ€™s what gets deployed to the blockchain.
- Within the bytecode there are **opcodes** that the EVM recognizes and executes. Opcodes are essentially the "commands" the EVM reads from the bytecode to know what to do.

When the EVM executes tasks, it is limited to the amount of gas provided by the transaction and the overall limitations of the EVM.

### How is the EVM designed?

The EVM operates off of a stack-based memory structure and contains memory components such as Memory, Storage, and Stack (which are used to read/write to the blockchain and manage state).

The EVM is considered _quasi-turing complete_: It can solve problems given a set of instructions but is limited by the amount of gas provided.

### How does the EVM operate?

Now we will explain how smart contract code (bytecode) is broken down into Opcodes.

Let's take a look at the bytecode from the Simple storage contract from the Remix IDE (This is the actual bytecode as of 06-NOV-2024):

```
6080604052348015600e575f80fd5b506101438061001c5f395ff3fe608060405234801561000f575f80fd5b5060043610610034575f3560e01c80632e64cec1146100385780636057361d14610056575b5f80fd5b610040610072565b60405161004d919061009b565b60405180910390f35b610070600480360381019061006b91906100e2565b61007a565b005b5f8054905090565b805f8190555050565b5f819050919050565b61009581610083565b82525050565b5f6020820190506100ae5f83018461008c565b92915050565b5f80fd5b6100c181610083565b81146100cb575f80fd5b50565b5f813590506100dc816100b8565b92915050565b5f602082840312156100f7576100f66100b4565b5b5f610104848285016100ce565b9150509291505056fea26469706673582212209a0dd35336aff1eb3eeb11db76aa60a1427a12c1b92f945ea8c8d1dfa337cf2264736f6c634300081a0033
```

Note that the EVM currently only uses around 140 unique opcodes; By design there can be a maximum of 256 single-byte opcodes: 256 possible unique values (from 0x00 to 0xFF).

You can use [evm.codes/playground](https://www.evm.codes/playground) to input the bytecode above and see how it is translated to opcodes.

#### The Ethereum State Transition Function

The **Ethereum State Transition Function** is a formula that the EVM processes every time it executes a transaction. This function makes sure transactions adhere to the standard and are technically valid (e.g., correct nonce and valid signature):

`Y(S, T)= S'`

Given an old valid state (S) and a new set of valid transactions (T), the Ethereum state transition function Y(S, T) produces a new valid output state S'.

## What are Ethereum accounts?

There are 2 types of accounts in Ethereum:

- externally owned accounts (EOA)
- smart contract accounts

Both account types can send and receive Ether (ETH) as well as interact with smart accounts deployed on the blockchain.

### Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)

An EOA is an account controlled by a cryptographic keypair. A key pair consists of a public key (a.k.a public address) and a private key.

It doesn't cost anything to generate an externally owned account (e.g., keypair), however, you will need to pay for transaction costs when writing (i.e., changing the state) on the Ethereum blockchain. EOAs do not store data or state; they simply can authorize state changes where they have authority.

**Assets are not directly held within an externally owned account (EOA); instead, they are associated with it through a mapping**.

### Smart Contract Accounts (SCA)

SCAs cost transaction fees to be created and do not contain a private key pair. But, they contain EVM code and storage. To summarize, smart contract accounts have the potential to offer more complex features, for example:

- Multi-signature transactions to require signatures from multiple parties before executing transactions
- Scheduled payments to automate recurring payments or subscriptions
- Set spending limits to control fund outflow
- Authorization controls and customized permissions to allow different wallet access/operations
- Conditional transactions based on specific states, such as price thresholds or time-based triggers
- Deployment of smart contracts, enabling modular structures for different types of operations

## QuickNode and Blockchain

In order for Ethereum to continue functioning, humans (for now ðŸ˜‰) need to run nodes (the hardware and software). There are different types of Ethereum client software like Geth or Nethermind. These are open-source and anyone can run them with the right hardware. However, many users don't have the hardware, experience or time to manage Ethereum nodes. This is where QuickNode plays a role.

QuickNode runs blockchain nodes for 25+ different blockchains

## Connecting to blockchains

This part is basically taken from the [Etherem docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/).
