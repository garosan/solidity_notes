The decentralized world computer

Key use cases and applications of Ethereum:

1. Token systems (ERC-20, NFTs, etc.)
2. Financial Derivatives and Stablecoins
3. Identity and Reputation Systems (ENS, etc.)
4. Decentralized File Storage (Filecoin, IPFS, etc.)
5. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

Other:

- On-chain decentralized marketplaces
- On-chain prediction markets
- Smart multisignature escrows
- Decentralized data feeds

Difference between web1, web2 and web3.

## [Ethereum Applications](https://docs.base.org/base-learn/docs/introduction-to-ethereum/ethereum-applications)

### The Ethos and Goals of Ethereum

The ethos of Ethereum is fundamentally different from Bitcoin's. Bitcoin development is conservative. In Bitcoin, changes are slow and any unnecessary risk-taking is generally frowned upon.

Ethereum development, is focused on innovation and experimentation.

Ethereum's primary goal is to be an all-purpose blockchain that allows developers to create any type of decentralized application. To allow this, smart contracts are crucial.

### Applications on Ethereum

Underlying forces of the smart contracts that make them possible:

#### Scripting

In the Ethereum whitepaper, Vitalik pointed out several limitations to Bitcoin scripting:

- Lack of Turing-completeness.
- Lack of state. Bitcoin's UTXO model only allows for simple contracts and not the complex stateful contracts needed for dapps.

#### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

DeFi applications are designed to provide traditional financial services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and much more, in a transparent, open and accessible manner.

Example of how lending and borrowing would work in a DeFi lending platform, such as Aave or Compound.

Although it's beyond the scope of this article, it's worth mentioning that DeFi has been the target of numerous smart contract exploits involving hundreds of millions of dollars in value.

#### Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

Ethereum's ERC-721 standard was the first to introduce NFTs in 2017, and it has since become the most popular standard for creating and trading NFTs on Ethereum.

#### Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

In simple words, DAOs are software-enabled, community-led organizations.

They allow a community to pool resources toward a shared goal. Because DAOs aren't tied to a physical location, they are able to mobilize quickly and attract resources and capital from all over the world.

The rules of a DAO are established by community members through the use of smart contracts. When a new DAO is created, a contract is deployed to the network.

DAOs typically use a token-based system to govern voting and decision-making. Members of the DAO are issued tokens that represent their ownership and influence within the organization. These tokens can be used to vote on proposals and allocate resources.

#### Other Applications

- Identity Management: The most notable example is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).
- Gaming: Axie Infinity and Decentraland are both popular examples. They make use of fungible and non-fungible tokens for a variety of purposes.
- Prediction markets: Augur and Gnosis are popular examples of this application. Also [PolyMarket](https://polymarket.com/)

There are many other use cases from supply chain, energy, and intellectual property management to decentralized storage and content management to governance and voting systems. The list goes on and on, and it's worth taking some time to explore these types of applications on your own.

### Evolution of the Web

- The Limitations of Web2

  - Privacy & Control
  - Censorship
  - Lack of transparency
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Limited interoperability

- The Limitations of Web3
  - Speed: Reliance on decentralized networks and consensus mechanisms result in much slower processing times
  - Storage: Storing data onchain can be very expensive
  - Smart contract limitations: limited to a maximum size of 24 KB, Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be updated or changed.
  - All data is public

#### Web2 vs Web3 Development
