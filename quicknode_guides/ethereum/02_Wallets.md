## Account Abstraction and ERC-4337

Custodial wallets are hard to handle and the user experience can be difficult. In this guide, we'll talk about ERC-4337, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) that aims to solve the issues of difficult wallet user experience.

EOAs and SCAs, these two types of accounts have some similarities in that they are restricted to using Ethereum's only signing signature, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).

### What is Account Abstraction / ERC-4337?

ERC-4337 isn't the first EIP to try and solve these challenges. It was first brought to attention in 2016 with EIP-86 (Abstraction of transaction origin and signature), then later again in 2020 with EIP-2938 and EIP-3074. Most of these EIPs were unsuccessful because they required core changes to the Ethereum protocol.
