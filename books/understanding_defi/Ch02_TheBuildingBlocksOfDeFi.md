# The Building Blocks of DeFi

These building blocks are protocols, platforms, decentralized applications (DApps), wallets, stablecoins, and governance tokens.

## Protocols

Protocols are just a set of rules and procedures. DeFi protocols are the rules and procedures for lending and borrowing without using banks. These protocols are used in one of two things: a platform or a DApp. Letâ€™s discuss the difference between the two.

## Platforms

Blockchain platforms, as they currently stand, have a few basic requirements and one main issue to resolve.

A Trilemma Solution

First, you need a trilemma solution. The blockchain trilemma is based on a classic issue in international finance regarding the three competing requirements of national monetary policy, only two of which can be achieved at any given time.

Accordingly, anyone trying to innovate in blockchain will have to address three competing interests, only two of which can be met by a blockchain solution. The interests are decentralization, scalability, and security.

Deployment Network

the structural base of the platform. In blockchain, this is fundamentally the block-based recordkeeping system.

You can use any language that works. Smart contracts are the programs that drive the whole system.

Blockchain currently runs on smart contracts that are triggered by tokens specific to that platform

The platform will need some sort of operational software to allow nodes to run the platform.
